# MYDIARY
This is an online journal where users can pen down their thoughts and feelings
So this repository contains five branches namely:
-login
-signup
-detail
-summary
-master
each of these branches (except the master branch) contains an HTML file, all of which are currently commited and updated, as in the local repository. 

The login, which is the login page, is for the user(who already has credentials) to login

The signup page is a page that is generated when you click the "Don't have an account? Create one" link on the login page, it redirects you to this link here file:///C:/Users/dell/Desktop/Andela/signup.html

The detail page is for the user to write a new entry and save

The Summary page is for the user to view all of the entries that have been into his/her diary.
